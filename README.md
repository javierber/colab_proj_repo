Data Visualization Exercise (Core)
Makeover Monday offers a weekly challenge to re-create or improve data visualizations. Your task is to choose one of the data visualizations to re-create or improve!

To do this:

Choose a data set from the Data Sets list. You can choose a recent data set or one from a previous year - as long as it interests you!
Download the data that you chose.
Use Python to create a visually appealing, informative visualization using the data you selected.
You also need to put your work for this assignment on GitHub, so everyone can see the awesome visualization you created!

To do this:

Create a new GitHub repository with an informative name for your visualization or data. (Note: here are instructions on how to do this if you are unsure - make sure to check the box marked "Initialize this repository with a README.")
Add your code to the GitHub repo you created. You can do this in Google Colab by selecting File > "Save a Copy In GitHub"
Edit the README to create an informative overview of the exercise that explains the purpose of the task/visualization, the data, and what the visualization you made shows/tells you. You may even want to include a static image of your final visualization in the README as well! (Note: README's are markdown files. Here is a cheatsheet of markdown syntax.) Try to make this as informative and professional as possible, as this is the first thing people will see when they come to your GitHub repo
